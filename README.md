# LED-Chaser-Circuit

•	Designed a LED chaser circuit from scratch, with it’s own power supply unit to convert AC input to suitable DC.

•	Components used are 555 timer IC, CD4017 decade counter IC, LEDs, potentiometer, resistors, PN junction diodes, connecting wires and soldering kit.

•	The timer IC generates trigger signals for the counter IC, the frequency of which could be varied by varying the value of the potentiometer. The decade counter IC consecutively generates high voltage signals at each of the ten outputs to which the LEDs are connected.

•	This project helped in understanding the concepts regarding the astable mode of operation of the 555 timer IC, the decade counter IC operation and the working of various other components used in the circuit.
